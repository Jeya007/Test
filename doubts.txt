1.I have a doubt in test procedure step 21,22 . I would like to know about the stat functionality. And also I like to get the stat test data to check the statistical chart and table reports.
2.Overdue reminders > Dynamic remainders> After we entering the custom time and tap left arrow, it is 'showing 5 reminders transactions queued ....' messages . Is it a bug? 

I would letting you know , In HTC one S (Android 4.0.4) , it shows our app half inch down, it impacts the bottom bar functions which are partially visible. 
Particularly, while displaying 'Habit details' page, either top bar will disappear or bottom bar functions are partially visible.

4.In the reward page, set the milestone 2(7 days) , gave past 7 days(actually gave 10 days) input and it didn't change the milestone and progress %. Does it need to change the status to 'Completed'?. Reward text and pic also didn't come.
